# Sticker API

A port of [YaBoiBurner/sticker-api](https://github.com/YaBoiBurner/sticker-api/) to rust,
with additional features I couldn't add to the node version.

Currently, this project is on hold semi-indefinitely [due to a lack of r2 support in workers-rs](https://github.com/cloudflare/workers-rs/issues/181).
Once it's supported, I will work more on this.
